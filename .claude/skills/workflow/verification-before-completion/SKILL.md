# Verification Before Completion

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status:
1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim
```

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build: exit 0 | Linter passing |
| Bug fixed | Original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence is not evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Linter passed" | Linter is not compiler |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |

## Key Patterns

```
Tests:     Run -> See "34/34 pass" -> THEN claim "All tests pass"
Red-Green: Write -> Run (pass) -> Revert -> Run (MUST FAIL) -> Restore -> Run (pass)
Build:     Run build -> See exit 0 -> THEN claim "Build passes"
Requirements: Re-read plan -> Checklist -> Verify each -> Report
Agent:     Agent reports -> Check VCS diff -> Verify changes -> Report actual state
```

## When To Apply

**ALWAYS before:** Any success/completion claim, any positive statement about work state, committing, PR creation, task completion, moving to next task, delegating to agents.

**No shortcuts. Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.**
